# ngx-surveys

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Development

* Clone repo
* Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building the Library

* Before we can use ngx-surveys library we need to build it:

```bash
ng build example-ngx-lib
```

* With Angular CLI v6.2 we can use the --watch flag so that every time a file changes Angular CLI performs a partial build that emits the amended files:

```bash
ng build example-ngx-lib --watch
```

* Run the application project (demo app to test our library):

```bash
ng serve
```

* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
